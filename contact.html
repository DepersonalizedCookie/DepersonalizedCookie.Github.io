    <h3>Bobert Smith</h3>  

    <p class="content"> 
        The craftsman behind Bob's Vegan Burgers had humble beginnings. He was born in XXXXXX, where burgers were few and far between. He went to college at Law Academy, but dropped out in his first year, because of a lack of motivation. After all the disappointment, at the tender age of 20 he decided to travel the world, but he could only afford a ticket to Budapest. That's where he met his purpose, the <strong>BURGER.</strong> He was raised to respect cows from an early age, so he knew, that his burgers would have to follow suit.
